"""Operations and Pipelines for ultrasound data processing.

This module contains two important classes, :class:`Operation` and :class:`Pipeline`,
which are used to process ultrasound data. A pipeline is a sequence of operations
that are applied to the data in a specific order.

We implement a range of common
operations for ultrasound data processing (:mod:`zea.ops.ultrasound`), but also support
a variety of basic tensor operations (:mod:`zea.ops.tensor`). Lastly, all existing Keras
operations (see `Keras Ops API <https://keras.io/api/ops/>`_) are available as `zea`
operations as well (see :mod:`zea.ops.keras_ops`).

Stand-alone manual usage
------------------------

Operations can be run on their own:

Examples
^^^^^^^^
.. doctest::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from zea.ops import EnvelopeDetect
    >>> data = np.random.randn(2000, 128, 1)
    >>> # static arguments are passed in the constructor
    >>> envelope_detect = EnvelopeDetect(axis=-1)
    >>> # other parameters can be passed here along with the data
    >>> envelope_data = envelope_detect(data=data)

Using a pipeline
----------------

You can initialize with a default pipeline or create your own custom pipeline.

.. doctest::

    >>> from zea.ops import Pipeline, EnvelopeDetect, Normalize, LogCompress
    >>> pipeline = Pipeline.from_default()

    >>> operations = [
    ...     EnvelopeDetect(),
    ...     Normalize(),
    ...     LogCompress(),
    ... ]
    >>> pipeline_custom = Pipeline(operations)

One can also load a pipeline from a config or yaml/json file:

.. doctest::

    >>> from zea import Pipeline

    >>> # From JSON string
    >>> json_string = '{"operations": ["identity"]}'
    >>> pipeline = Pipeline.from_json(json_string)

    >>> # from yaml file
    >>> import yaml
    >>> from zea import Config
    >>> # Create a sample pipeline YAML file
    >>> pipeline_dict = {
    ...     "operations": [
    ...         {"name": "identity"},
    ...     ]
    ... }
    >>> with open("pipeline.yaml", "w") as f:
    ...     yaml.dump(pipeline_dict, f)
    >>> yaml_file = "pipeline.yaml"
    >>> pipeline = Pipeline.from_yaml(yaml_file)

.. testcleanup::

    import os

    os.remove("pipeline.yaml")

Example of a yaml file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    pipeline:
      operations:
        - name: demodulate
        - name: beamform
          params:
            type: das
            pfield: false
            num_patches: 100
        - name: envelope_detect
        - name: normalize
        - name: log_compress
